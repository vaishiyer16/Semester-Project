#Semester Project

Description

This project is part of a semester-long data science course.

The project follows the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) structure to ensure modularity, reproducibility, and clarity. It includes:

- Data acquisition from an online source
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualizations for data insights and model performance
