# Semester Project — Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

# 📉 Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

This project predicts customer churn in the telecom industry using supervised machine learning models. By identifying which customers are likely to leave, companies can proactively reduce churn and improve customer retention strategies. The project was built as part of the INST414 semester project at the University of Maryland.
