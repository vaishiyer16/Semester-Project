# Semester Project — Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project uses machine learning to identify and understand customer churn behavior in a telecommunications dataset. The goal is to model customer attrition based on contract type, billing, and service usage — and interpret results through a social science lens.

#Semester Project

Description

This project is part of a semester-long data science course.

The project follows the [Cookiecutter Data Science](https://drivendata.github.io/cookiecutter-data-science/) structure to ensure modularity, reproducibility, and clarity. It includes:

- Data acquisition from an online source
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Visualizations for data insights and model performance
