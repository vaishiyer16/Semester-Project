# 🌱 Semester Project: Semester Project

## 📌 Project Description

This is a semester-long data science project focused on [briefly describe your topic, e.g., predicting student performance / analyzing climate data / detecting fake news]. 

The project follows the **Cookiecutter Data Science** structure for better organization, reproducibility, and collaboration.

The pipeline includes:
- Data acquisition
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model development and evaluation
- Visualization and reporting

Install the following packages in a virtual environment (Python 3.9+):

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- joblib
- jupyter
- (add any others you use)
